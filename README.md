with the sylt programming language.

*NOTE: Under heavy development*

## Getting started
There are two ways this engine can be used:

2. Clone thie repository and write the game in the engine

## Some nice features
 - Sylt integration, for fast prototyping
 - Particles, lots and lots of particles
 - Fast build times, dependencies are kept to a minimum to make it quick to get started
 - Written in Rust
